## Introduction <a name = "intro"></a>

Hand Gesture Recognition is a technology that enables computers to interpret human gestures as commands. It works by capturing and analyzing the movements of the hands to recognize specific gestures and translate them into actions. This technology has a wide range of applications, from robotics and gaming to assistive technologies and human-computer interaction. Static Hand Gesture Recognition is a subset of this technology that focuses on recognizing static hand poses or shapes, which can be used to classify different gestures and commands based on a frame-by-frame analysis of the hand's position and shape.

### Importance and Applications 

One of the main applications of Hand Gesture Recognition is Human-Robot Interaction and Human Computer Interaction. By using hand gestures as commands, users can control robots, computers, and other devices in a more intuitive and natural way. This technology is particularly useful in scenarios where traditional input devices like keyboards and mice are not practical or feasible, such as in robotics, virtual reality, and augmented reality applications. Hand Gesture Recognition can also be used in healthcare, gaming, and security applications, among others.

## Project Description <a name = "project"></a>

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a real-time gesture recognition system that allows users to play a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against a computer. The system will capture live video feeds of the user's hand gestures using a camera, analyze the movements to recognize the gestures using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks framed as a classification task, and translate them into commands to play the game. The computer will generate its own gestures randomly, and the system will determine the winner based on the rules of the game.

### Key Goals
**Motion Detection**: Utilize a standard smartphone camera to capture hand movements and translate them into commands.  
**Deep CNN Classification**: Implement a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify hand gestures in real-time.
**User-Friendly Interface**: Develop a simple and intuitive GUI that displays the live video and the game interface. 
**Mobile Application**: Implement a mobile application that allows users to play the game using their smartphones.
**Comparison of Models**: Compare the performance of different CNN models for gesture recognition, as well as the impact of data augmentation techniques.

### Software
**Motion Detection Software**
The core of the gesture control system is the motion detection software. This software processes the video feed from the webcam to identify and interpret hand gestures. _(talk about techniques for motion detection such as background subtraction, frame differencing, and optical flow)_
